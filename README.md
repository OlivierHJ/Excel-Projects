"# Excel-Projects" 
The file was too large, so I had to break it up into chunks. The 6 Training files need to be merged together into the "Training" tab, and the one test file
needs to be placed into the "testing" tab.

You could mix and match Training and testing files as you see fit. 

I couldn't get over 85% match rate with the current setup. I imagine if I added more hidden layers I could increase the number - but calculation time would also increase.
